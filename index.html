    6 years ago as a newcomer; after living in Lebanon as a refigee for four years. I am sudying IMD because I am Passionate about photography and videography; however, photography is my focus, especially fashion photography . I dream of moving to New York to work with big fahion brands
Also, I want to learn web designing because I like tech, and I believe web designing has a future because everything is online nowadays, and everyone needs a website, especially since most companies and businesses are selling online.
